# NetLinx Compile

netlinx-compile

A wrapper utility for the AMX NetLinx compiler.

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/netlinx-compile.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/netlinx-compile)

This library provides an executable, `netlinx-compile`, that wraps the `nlrc.exe` NetLinx compiler provided by AMX. It is designed for easier command line access, as well as for integration with third-party tools with source code build support, like text editors and IDE's. Also provided in this library is a Ruby API for invoking the NetLinx compiler.


## Upgrade Notice

AMX has broken NetLinx compilier functionality between NLRC.exe v1.0 (distributed
in NetLinx Studio 3) and NLRC.exe v2.1 (distributed in NetLinx Studio 4). It is
recommended that users ***DO NOT UPGRADE TO NETLNX STUDIO 4*** until AMX resolves
these issues.


Version 1.x of netlinx-compile targets NLRC.exe v1.x.
Version 2.x of netlinx-compile targets NLRC.exe v2.x.
